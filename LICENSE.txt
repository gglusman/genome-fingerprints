Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) Non-Profit Software License

PREAMBLE
This License is for Covered Software that creates digital 'fingerprints' that preserves distances between the source data without preserving other identifiable features.  
The Covered Software is offered under this License at no cost to Non-Profit Organizations (hereinafter 'NPOs') for their internal use and modification. NPOs may also distribute the Covered Software, including Modifications, to other NPOs under this License and may make publicly available libraries of fingerprints, whether created using the Original Software or Modifications. In order to insure the ability to compare fingerprints in different libraries, any organization modifying the Original Software or Covered Software must provide a copy of the Modifications to ISB, who may then use, sublicense, copy or modify those Modifications. 
This License does not permit the distribution of the Covered Software to for-profit organizations or the performing of services for for-profit organizations using the Covered Software. Please contact ISB for licenses of the Covered Software to or for the benefit of for-profit organizations.
This License states the complete agreement between ISB and User for the Covered Software and User agrees to carefully read this License before downloading, installing, accessing or using the Covered Software. By downloading, installing, accessing or using the Covered Software, you are agreeing to the terms of this License. If you are not willing to be bound by this License, then you must not download, install, access, or use the Covered Software.

The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.
       1.6	'Trigger Date' shall mean the first to occur of: (a) the provision to any third party of access to any Modification; or (b) the provision to any third party or public release of data or other materials produced in whole or in part by a Modification.

2.	LICENSES
       2.1	License to User.  ISB hereby grants User, and User accepts, a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to the Original Software and a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive sublicense to the Modifications licensed to ISB under Section 2.3, each of which includes the right to use, reproduce, and modify the Original Software and such Modifications, and to sublicense the Original Software with or without Modifications to other NPOs generally and as identified in Section 3.1 under this License.
       2.2	License is Non-Commercial.  The license granted in Section 2.1 is limited solely to non-commercial uses by User.  User shall not reproduce, sublicense, or otherwise distribute the Covered Software to or for the benefit of a for-profit organization or any entity that would not qualify as a User under this License.
       2.3	License of Modifications.  Upon the Trigger Date, User hereby grants ISB, and ISB accepts, a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, publish, distribute, and sublicense any and all Modifications of User. The foregoing license and any sublicense shall include any intellectual property rights the User has the power to license whether at the time of the Trigger Date or thereafter, including, without limitation, copyrights, patent rights, trade secrets and trademarks.
       2.4	No Other Rights.  Nothing contained in this License or ISB's performance hereunder shall be construed as conferring upon any other party any right, title or interest under any property right, except for those rights expressly granted in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, and none shall be implied.  All rights, titles and interests are expressly reserved by ISB. Nothing in this License shall grant User any rights to use any of the trademarks of ISB, even if such trademarks are included in Covered Software or its documentation.

3.	ADDITIONAL USER OBLIGATIONS
       3.1	Application of License.  Modifications which User creates or to which User contributes are governed by the terms of this License. Covered Software may be distributed by User only under the terms of this License, and User agrees to include a copy of this License and the Required Notices set forth on Sections. 3.3 and 3.5 with every copy of Covered Software that User distributes. User may not offer or impose any terms on the Covered Software that alters or restricts this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
       3.2	Delivery of Source Code for Modifications.  User must provide to ISB a copy of all Source Code for any Modification of User that is subject to the license in Section 2.3.  Such Source Code shall be delivered to ISB no later than five (5) days after the Trigger Date by uploading to https://github.com and emailing to gustavo@systemsbiology.org.
       3.3	Description of Modifications.  User must cause all Modifications to contain a file documenting the changes User made and the date of any change.
       3.4	Intellectual Property Matters. 
       (a)	Third Party Claims.  If User has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property may be required to exercise the rights granted under Section 2.3, User must include a text file with the Source Code titled 'LEGAL' which identifies the third party and its intellectual property in sufficient detail that ISB or another User will know whom to contact. If User obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Sections 2.3 and 3.2, User shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies User makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software, including ISB.
       (b)	Representations.  User represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, User believes that its Modifications are User's original creation(s) and User has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
       3.5	Required Notices.  User must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of Covered Software it distributes. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file, then User must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a User would be likely to look for such a notice. User must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where User describes recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. 

4.	FEDERAL FUNDING  User understands that patent rights of ISB or Original Software may have been conceived or first actually reduced to practice, or following the first date upon which User downloads, installs, accesses or uses software may be first actually reduced to practice with funding from the U.S. government. All rights granted in this License shall be limited by and subject to the rights of the United States government, including those set forth in 35 U.S.C. §200 et seq. ('Bayh-Dole Act').  User agrees to comply and permit ISB to comply with the Bayh-Dole Act, including to provide the reporting required and to substantially manufacture in the United States, unless waived.

SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, USER SHALL ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. 

6.	TERMINATION

       6.2	If User initiates litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against ISB alleging that the Original Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to User under this License shall automatically terminate.
       6.3	If it becomes impossible for User to comply with any term of this License, User must provide written notice to ISB within ten (10) days of discovering such impossibility. Upon receiving written notice from User, ISB may terminate this License with respect to User.
